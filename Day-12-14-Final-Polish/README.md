# My Todo App – CLI Task Manager (Day 12-14 Final Version)

A simple but powerful command-line todo app I built to manage daily tasks.

### Features
- Add tasks with title, priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), category, note
- View all tasks (sorted by priority)
- Mark task as complete
- Delete task
- Beautiful colored output (thanks to Rich library)
- All data saved in `tasks.json` – survives program restart

### How to Run
```bash
python main.py
