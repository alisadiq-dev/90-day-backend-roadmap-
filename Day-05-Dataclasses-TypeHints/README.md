 # Day 05 – Dataclasses & Type Hints

Today I made my Day 04 bank code better and cleaner!

### What I did today:
- Used @dataclass → no need to write __init__ again
- Added type hints → now Python knows what kind of data should come
- Used mypy → it checks my code before running

### Files:
- typed_bank.py → main code (super clean)
- main.py → to test everything
- requirements.txt → has "mypy"

### How to run:
1. Open terminal
2. Type:  
   ```bash
   pip install mypy
   python main.py
