# Day 04 – Bank System Project
  
Today I learned and used two important things:

### What I Did Today
1. **Inheritance**  
   - Made SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount from BankAccount  
   - They automatically get deposit, withdraw, balance etc. from parent class

2. **Composition**  
   - Added TransactionHistory inside the account  
   - Now every account has its own history (has-a relationship)

3. Used `super()` correctly  
4. Overrode withdraw() in CheckingAccount for overdraft

### Files in this folder
- `bank.py` → all my code is here
- `output.txt` → what you see when you run the code
- `README.md` → this file you are reading
